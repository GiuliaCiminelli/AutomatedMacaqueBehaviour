# AutomatedMacaqueBehaviour
The Automated Macaque Behavior repository contains four folders, each dedicated to a specific project:

- Enrichment_Yolcat: This folder contains Python and R scripts designed to extract movement data using a YOLACT-based model trained to recognize an enrichment item. Additionally, it includes an Excel file with feeding time data, which is required for the R script and subsequent statistical analyses.

- Enrichment_Yolo: This folder contains Python and R scripts for extracting data on the number of macaques interacting with an enrichment puzzle. The YOLO-based model is located in the 'Model' sub-folder. Additionally, there is an Excel file with group information, including size and type, which is required for the statistical analyses performed by the R script.

- Foraging: This directory is subdivided into three sub-folders, each aligning with a distinct project. Every sub-folder contains Python and R scripts for extracting data on the number of macaques foraging.
  
- Temperament Test: Here, you will find Python scripts for extracting information from three models: two based on DeepLabCut and one based on YOLACT.

Please note that the YOLACT and DeepLabCut models are available upon request.


Objective:

The goal of these projects is to automatically provide information for assessing and improving macaque welfare within a breeding colony.
