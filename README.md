# AutomatedMacaqueBehaviour
The Automated Macaque Behavior repository contains four folders, each dedicated to a specific project:

Enrichment_Yolcat: This folder includes Python and R scripts for extracting movement information from a Yolcat-based model trained to recognize an enrichment item.

Enrichment_Yolo: Inside this folder, you will find Python and R scripts for extracting the number of macaques interacting with an enrichment puzzle. The Yolo-based model can be found in the 'Model' sub-folder.

Foraging: This directory is divided into three sub-folders, each corresponding to a specific project. Each sub-folder contains Python and R scripts for extracting the number of macaques engaged in foraging activities.

Temperament Test: Here, you will find Python scripts for extracting information from three models: two based on DeepLabCut and one based on Yolact.

Please note that the Yolact and DeepLabCut models are available upon request.


Objective:

The goal of these projects is to automatically provide information for assessing and improving macaque welfare within a breeding colony.
